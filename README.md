# CT7111-Audio-Visualisation
AUDIO VISUALISER PROJECT V1.1

Key Features:
Automatic visualisation of any audio inputs.
Customisable, varied types of audio visualisers (Spectogram Array, Niagara Particles, Active Texture, L/R Channels)

How to Use:
In order to add new music, update these 4 parameters with the desired audio: 
Audio Host - Sound, Constant Waveform Analysis, Loudness Waveform Analysis and Onset Waveform Analysis.
All core parameters can be found on the AudioHost Blueprint. 
Fine Tune parameters can be found on each individual visualiser.
Once the audio file has been entered into the 4 files listed above, hit Play.

Problems: Unifying all the audio inputs turned out to be a much more complex task than I had originally anticipated, resulting in me unable to unify all the audio inputs under one variable.
